This module is designed to teach learners how to use Python for computer vision tasks, specifically in the context of recognising people in both video and photo formats using OpenCV. The module begins by introducing the fundamental concepts of computer vision, including image processing, feature extraction, and object recognition. The learners will be given an introduction to OpenCV, the most popular library used for computer vision tasks in Python. Throughout the module, learners will have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in hands-on exercises and projects. By the end of the module, learners will be able to use Python and OpenCV to perform basic computer vision tasks such as recognising people in both video and photo formats. They will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of computer vision, as well as the practical skills required to work with cameras and images in Python using OpenCV.


Covers how to use OpenCV to work with cameras and videos. 
This includes how to capture video frames from a webcam or other camera, display the frames, and how to detect people in the video frames using object detection. The learners will also learn about face detection, which is a crucial component of people detection. They will be guided through the process of using pre-trained Haar cascades for face detection.

Recognise people in photos. 
The learners will be introduced to how to load and display images using OpenCV. They will be taught how to train a face recognition model and use it to recognise people in the photo. The learners will also learn how to identify the key features of a face, extract them from the photo, and compare them to the features of known individuals in order to make an identification.
