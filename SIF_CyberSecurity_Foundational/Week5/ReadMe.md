The output of a port scan can vary depending on the method used and the tool being used to perform the scan. In the Python code provided above, the output will be printed to the console and will indicate whether each port in the specified list is open or closed. The output will be in the form of text messages, as follows:

If a port is open: the message "Port [port number] is open" will be printed to the console, where [port number] is the number of the open port being scanned.

If a port is closed: the message "Port [port number] is closed" will be printed to the console, where [port number] is the number of the closed port being scanned.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:
Port 21 is open
Port 22 is closed
Port 80 is open
Port 443 is closed

In this example, the Python script has scanned ports 21, 22, 80, and 443 on the target machine and has determined that ports 21 and 80 are open, while ports 22 and 443 are closed.

Note that there may be other types of output from more advanced port scanning tools, such as graphical interfaces, detailed reports, or integration with other security tools. However, the basic output from a port scan will typically indicate which ports are open and closed on the target machine.
