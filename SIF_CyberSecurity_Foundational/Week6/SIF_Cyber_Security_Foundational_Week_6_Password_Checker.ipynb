        "Password Complexity: ISO 27000 requires passwords to be complex, containing a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. NIST, on the other hand, recommends the use of long and easy-to-remember passphrases, rather than complex passwords.\n",

        "Password Aging: ISO 27000 recommends password aging policies, which require users to change their passwords periodically. NIST, however, recommends against password aging policies, instead encouraging the use of multi-factor authentication and other security measures."
