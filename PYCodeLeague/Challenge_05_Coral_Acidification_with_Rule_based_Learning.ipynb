As a result, Maya often found herself in a dilemma about whether or not to bring an umbrella with her when she went out.\n",

Her second rule was that if the chance of rain was between 30% and 60%, she should bring an umbrella just in case. Finally, Maya's third rule was that if the chance of rain was greater than 60%, she should definitely bring an umbrella as it was going to rain.\n",
