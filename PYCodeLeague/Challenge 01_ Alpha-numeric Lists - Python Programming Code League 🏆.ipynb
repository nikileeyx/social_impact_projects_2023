When a new largest element is found, the previous largest element is stored in a variable, and the iteration continues until the end of the list is reached. The second largest element is then returned.\n","\n","This problem is also a good exercise for you to improve your algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills in Python, as it involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps and identifying the appropriate logic to implement the solution! üåü"],"metadata":{"id":"jCl85Mr5k8OF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Error and Bug Reporting üëª\n","\n","If you face any errors or bugs in the code, please send an email to Niki at niki.lee@sustainablelivinglab.org !"],"metadata":{"id":"oCeSe-K1aMfo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Task 1 List\n","\n","The first list of numbers is, 1, 30, 49, 21, 4"],"metadata":{"id":"fkIxqXtblXSa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Enter your code here with the relevant comments to explain your code\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6JlEMTwhlbUk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Task 2 List\n","\n","The first list of numbers is, 10000000, 30, 49, 21, 4, -1, 49"],"metadata":{"id":"Jmhi_p5hlguj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Enter your code here with the relevant comments to explain your code\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vV0jAIV1ll3k"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Task 3 List\n","\n","The first list of numbers is, 20, 3O, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1"],"metadata":{"id":"yA_2k-Z9lnQJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Enter your code here with the relevant comments to explain your code\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3FoKt9urlnZA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Once you have completed all the three questions, save a copy and turn in your solution to the Google Classroom!
